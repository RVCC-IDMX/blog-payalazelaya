Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. And just raise cain. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Don't fiddle with it all day.

This is unplanned it really just happens. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. We'll put a happy little sky in here. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.

A fan brush can be your best friend. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Just use the old one inch brush. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.

You can create anything that makes you happy. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.

And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.
